# Movie-Store
A movie store design utilizing polymorphism and abstraction to allow for easy addition of movies and commands.
----
Through use of abstract factories, both the movie and command objects are able to access and initialize a variety of different types of objects without knowing any additional information about it. This shows my understanding of polymorphism, as well as object-oriented design since each object is seperated into their own classes with specific header files. 
Currently the commands are borrow, return, inventory, and history but more can be added later on. The same goes for movie types. While there are currently only classics, comedies, and dramas this code allows for easy addition of other types.
